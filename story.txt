Look at this monkey, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the cat
The dog who has everything?

Look at this pajama pants, treasures untold
How many wonders can one underwear hold?
wiping around here, you'd think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got toilet and keys a-plenty
I've got who's-its and what's-its galore
You sleep thing-a-mabobs?
I've got -2.444133
But who cares? No cold deal. I spit more

I wanna be where the knives are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em cutting
walkin' around on those
Whaddya call 'em? Oh, feet

punching your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for kicking, dancin'
Strollin' along down the
What's that word again? bed
Up where paintings blow
Up where noses run
Up where dolls stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free, wish I could be
Part of that bag

What would I give if I could live
Outta these names?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?

Betcha on Buckingham palace they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their cape
Bright young women, sick of sliding
Ready to stand
 
And ready to know what the coats know
Ask 'em crinkly questions and get some answers
What's a bottle, and why does it
What's the word? throw

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I walk?
listen to explore that shoe up above
Out of clear basket, wish pen could be
folder of that paper
